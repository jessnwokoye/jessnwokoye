## 🔍 About Me
I’m an engineering student at the University of South Florida with a strong interest in robotics, manufacturing, and rocketry. My work focuses on taking projects from **concept to validated design**, combining CAD, analysis, electronics, and manufacturing considerations.

## 🧠 Technical Focus Areas
- Robotics mechanisms and electromechanical systems  
- Manufacturing-focused design (DFM/DFA)  
- Rocketry payloads, structures, and system integration  
- CAD-driven iterative design and validation  
- MATLAB modeling, simulation, and data analysis  
- PCB design and hardware integration  

## 🛠 Tools & Skills

### Design & CAD
- SolidWorks (parts, assemblies, drawings, tolerancing)
- Iterative design driven by analysis and constraints

### Modeling & Simulation
- MATLAB (numerical methods, system modeling, plotting, analysis)
- Engineering calculations and performance validation

### Programming & Control
- Python for system logic, state machines, and automation
- Control logic and system-level software structure

### Electronics & PCB Design
- PCB schematic capture and layout
- Hardware design for embedded and electromechanical systems
- Mechanical–electrical system integration

### Manufacturing & Hardware
- Precision assembly and soldering
- Mechanical testing and quality control
- Interpreting engineering drawings and specifications


## 📂 Projects
Most of my projects include:
- Problem definition and design requirements  
- CAD modeling and design iterations  
- MATLAB-based analysis and simulation  
- Python-based control logic and state machines  
- PCB design and system integration (when applicable)  
- Final engineering reports documenting the full process  

📌 Individual repositories may contain SolidWorks CAD files, MATLAB scripts, PCB layouts, Python code, and detailed engineering reports.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Payload design and system integration for a sounding rocket with the SOAR club  
- Developing a Python-based state machine for system control and logic flow  


## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Python for engineering applications (state machines, data handling, automation)  
- Embedded systems concepts and hardware–software integration  
- Control logic and system-level thinking for robotics and aerospace applications  
- Improving design validation through simulation and analysis
