**🔍 About Me**
I’m an engineering student at the University of South Florida with a strong interest in robotics, manufacturing, and rocketry. My work focuses on taking projects from **concept to validated design**, combining CAD, analysis, electronics, and manufacturing considerations.

**🔭 I’m currently working on**
- Payload design and system integration for a sounding rocket with the SOAR club  
- Developing a Python-based state machine for system control and logic flow  

**🌱 I’m currently learning**
- Python for engineering applications (state machines, data handling, automation)  
- Embedded systems concepts and hardware–software integration  
- Control logic and system-level thinking for robotics and aerospace applications  
- Improving design validation through simulation and analysis
